Windows authentication

Windows Authentication relies on the operating system to authenticate users ‚Ä¶ used for servers that run on a corporate network using Active Directory domain identities ‚Ä¶ best suited to intranet environments where users, client apps, and web servers belong to the same Windows domain.

üõë Why It Doesn‚Äôt Work for a Pure REST API
A pure REST API (like your backend) does not have a UI or redirect capability. So:

There‚Äôs no browser to show a Microsoft login popup.

There‚Äôs no way to redirect to Azure AD login.

There‚Äôs no session or UI context.

It‚Äôs meant to be accessed by:

JavaScript (from a frontend app)

Other services (machine-to-machine)

üëâ That‚Äôs why REST APIs use token-based authentication only ‚Äî you must provide a Bearer token from a login process that already happened elsewhere (e.g., web frontend or postman or service).




Here's a concise and clear response you can send to the support team or include in your incident report to help them understand the issue:

üìù Incident Summary: OperationCanceledException in GraphQL API
Timestamp (UTC): 2025-07-02T23:38:46.425987Z
Exception: System.OperationCanceledException
Library: HotChocolate.Execution (v13.9.1.40)
Method: WorkScheduler.ExecuteInternalAsync

üí• What Happened:
The system threw an OperationCanceledException during the execution of a GraphQL query. This occurs when the current operation is explicitly cancelled by the runtime before completion.

üìå Root Cause:
This is not an unhandled bug but an expected exception when a task is cancelled due to one of the following:

The client aborted the HTTP request (e.g. user navigated away or closed the browser tab).
A timeout occurred (server-side or from infrastructure like a load balancer).
A cancellation token was triggered intentionally (e.g. due to request timeout policy or graceful shutdown).
üß© Technical Details:
The cancellation originated in System.Threading.CancellationToken.ThrowOperationCanceledException().
The request was being processed by HotChocolate.Execution.Processing.WorkScheduler.ExecuteInternalAsync.
The outer message confirms: "The operation was canceled."
‚úÖ Next Steps:
Monitor for frequency ‚Äî if this is rare, it is most likely due to client-side or environmental interruptions.
Review timeout configuration in GraphQL setup and hosting environment:
GraphQL .SetRequestTimeout(...)
Web server timeouts (Kestrel/IIS/Nginx/etc.)
Log cancellation reason (if applicable) by checking cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested in resolvers.
‚ÑπÔ∏è Conclusion:
This is a controlled exception indicating the operation was cancelled, likely due to timeout or client disconnect. No action is required unless it becomes frequent or affects user experience.
